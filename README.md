# Weather-Dashboard

# Description

Hi! In this weather dashboard you are able to search for the weather in a specific city. Once the search results appear you are also given a 5-day forecast. The UV Index is color coordinated with the severity of weather. Favorable is green, moderate is yellow and severe is red. The previous searches are saved in localStorage and the five most recent searches are available as buttons for easy access and re-searching weather and forecasts.

Some of the weather conditions include:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Wind Speed
- UV Index
